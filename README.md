It is the code repository for my [A star algorithm](https://gameidea.org/2023/12/04/pathfinding-using-a-algorithm/) tutorial on my website. Feel free to do whatever you want to do with it.

## Notes
1. I suggest you read [dijkstra algorithm](https://gameidea.org/2023/11/30/pathfinding-using-dijkstras-algorithm/) first before starting A*.
